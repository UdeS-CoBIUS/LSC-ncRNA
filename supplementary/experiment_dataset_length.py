# experiment_dataset_length:
#  generate a graph where on the X axis put family size (number of seqs),
#  and on Y axis the average len of seqs.
#  this for 3 dataset:
#  1) Rfam dataset,
#  2) Noise dataset for 0 noise,
#  3) Clan dataset (and for Rfam from clans)
#
# 	  for that we have compute for each family 1) number of seqs, and the average len seqs.
