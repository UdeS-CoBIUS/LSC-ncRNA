 Large Scale Classification of non-coding RNA



# Experimentation Pipeline
-1- get the dataset: Download the ncRNA from somewhere, form example Rfam (https://rfam.xfam.org/)

-2- Train Test split: For each family (fasta file), split the sequnces into train and test dataset.

-3- generate the matrix.
